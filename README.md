### **Task 1: Schedule of Deliverables for Project Managers**

**Background:** When starting a new project, PMs follow a schedule of deliverables given to them in the form of a Microsoft Word document. Instead of just a checklist, this script turns the list of activities into a Google Calendar with each item offset by the required number of days from the project's start date. Activities can now be shared, delegated and are otherwise more accessible.   

**Use:** Users have two inputs: Calendar Name and Project Start Date. Clicking the artistically made "Create Calendar" button prompts users to authorize the script and creates the calendar for the user. 

**Sample:** See script in action here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M-yxPHlObbHmXoCbd8yMNBAsM18JwgQ7JlnWXY4G-Xw/edit?usp=sharing

**Future Additions:**  
- Allow for changes to original list of deliverables
- Save these changes as a new tab for quick reuse
